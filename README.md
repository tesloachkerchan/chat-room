Chatroom App with React.js and Socket.io
This is a simple chatroom application built using React.js on the client side and Socket.io on the server side. Users can join a given room using its ID and chat with others in real-time.

Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders:

Client
The client folder contains the front-end part of the application built with React.js. It includes components, styles, and logic for the chatroom interface.

Server
The server folder contains the back-end part of the application built with Socket.io. It handles the real-time communication between users in the chatroom.

Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

Navigate to the client folder and run npm install to install the dependencies.

Run npm start to start the React.js development server for the client.

Navigate to the server folder and run npm install to install the dependencies.

Run npm start to start the Socket.io server for the back-end.

Once both the client and server are running, you can access the chatroom app in your web browser.

Usage
Open the app in your web browser.
Enter the room ID to join a specific chatroom.
Start chatting with other users in real-time.
